# Getting aned Cleaning Data course project

This repository contains the following files:

* run_analysis.R: Script for generating the tables
* codebook.md: code book describing the data

run_analysis.R expects the HAR data to be placed in a directory called
"data". There are commented lines near the top of the script that will
download and unpack the data if uncommented.
